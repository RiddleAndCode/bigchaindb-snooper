## For when you quickly need to query the network.

I really needed a visual tool which I could use to search for assets on a certain BigchainDB network on the fly. I didn't really found one so I decided to create one. Enjoy!

# How to use

You just [load the page](https://artus.github.io/bigchaindb-snooper/) and start typing a string you want to query! Click on an asset to get a list of transactions and click on a transaction to get a detailed overview of its data.

By default, the snooper will point to the [official BigchainDB Testnet](https://testnet.bigchaindb.com/), but you can point it to any node by changing the URL in the settings pane.
